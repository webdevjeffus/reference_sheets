# Web Development Reference Sheets

## My Own Resources
These reference sheets provide quick access to basic syntax models, code snippets and brief explanations of topics related to web development. I created most of them for my own use while enrolled in the web dev immersive program at Dev Bootcamp in New York. I share them here with future web dev students (at DBC and elsewhere) to "pay forward" all the help and support given to me by my teachers, mentors, and peers at DBC and on the wider web.
